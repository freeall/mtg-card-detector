# py-mtg-card-identifer

This has been forked from https://github.com/tmikonen/magic_card_detector.

The change is to turn it more into returning the card name and not generating images.
I've also added requirements.txt so it's easier for others to run.

## Test

```
$ python test/test.py
```

Some test cases to test both `generate-hashes.py` and `magic_card_detector.py`
